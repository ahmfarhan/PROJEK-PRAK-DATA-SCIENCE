"1","the app is really slow i had paid for instant conselour session but it took a long time only to open the chat box even when i tried to open other feature it only keeps loading when the chatbox was opened and i wrote all of my problems there were no response at all i have waited for  hour and i dont know when will she start responding wanted to use this app to relieve my stress but it only stress me out even more i shouldve listened to all the bad review to not use this app"
"2","im not quite sure whether my concern fall to the false advertising category or not but putting tanpa harus menunggu and youll ended up have to wait at least for a week to get a schedule is quite a low shot i understand the scheduling would be a hassle but that is the service that you guys are trying to sell i honestly felt cheated when i was about to buy the package if i can have a say either change the ads or fix your scheduling system thank you"
"3","often login failed app is suck because i tried login many times but cant finished you must fix your backend process"
"4","waiting too long for a psychologists reply makes me even more frustrated even though its still at the beginning of the session to set the counseling schedule i hope this app can set the schedule automatically at first according to the psychologists availability it looks like psychologist are busy with other things and dont focus on responding to what i told them their answers way too standart even i can find it on many articles on the internet really like this app tho please fix this"
"5","i am using this for meditation since i believe counseling is better in doing it offline the meditation helps me a lot i know that meditation wont solve your problem instantly but the key is consistency so far i see my self getting better in keeping my focus and enrich my mindfulness so thank you"
"6","been using this app since january  this app helps me maintain my moods my sleeping time and take care of my mental health the journal helps a little but still need sum improvement it would be nice if the psychologcounselors could review our daily journal while we do counseling chat and also please improve the app to help those who had selfharmed issue and sudal thoughts but over all keep on the good works riliv"
"7","i used this app and their service several times and the therapist is always able to find the solution of my problem sometimes the solution is just as simple as mindset shift which i didnt see because i was too focus on the problem the therapists are very kind and able to listen without judging or belittle me and my problems thank you"
"8","there are only  genders to choose from it makes me feel rather uncomfortable but other than that everything is okay ive heard that the counseling chat is pretty good so ill try that out soon edit i just recently checked the app again and im so glad changes have been made since my last visit the pricing for the therapy sessions are thankfully affordable for me personally but i can see it being quite pricey for some but i do think that they have a lot of really good free materials"
"9","this app is really helpful besides providing online counselling with professionals it does give me self help guidance for meditations journaling helping me to get better sleep and especially the emergency ones please keep this up and better in the future"
"10","great app would be better if the meditation track can be played offline when the network quality is bad the meditation track will stop and i have to restart it offline playing will also be helpful when meditating in airplane"
"11","this app really helps me practice my meditation it offers guided meditation and step by step to improve my mind i was full of selfdoubt and anxiety before ive been meditating for about  month and i feel a lot calmer now another thing i notice is i also appreciate the little things in life more worth every penny"
"12","best app for selfhealing recommended and really worth to try guided meditation helps me to be more mindful about myself being aware and accept myself reduce my anxiety and stress meditation also helps me to become more driven and focused it helps me sleep better as well from meditation i learn that happiness is all on my mind "
"13","besically its good app but my perfectionist side of me hates it when the chat didnt start with a capital letters and the notifications where are they lol also about the psycholog is helpful but one i got they asked me back abouut my own confusion i understand its pretty subjective but still its just intricate details that i decided to give this app four star"
"14","easy to use price is okayish would be happy if its cheaper but i mean its still cheaper than most looking forward for more features"
"15","while i rarely use this app it provides contents that help me calm down during my panic or stress sessions ill give four stars since i havent tested out its full features yet but the contents i have discovered are helpful"
"16","the app is useless so i will rate it as  cuz this is google playstore right ehe we use line for consultation instead because theres a trouble with the app dam i hate line lol hope they can provide better social media instead of line for the consultation i bought the x consultation package k each k total its kinda worth it till we do the th consultation but because i kinda ignored line for a reason after the th they ignored me back  we lost contacts kinda dissapointed"
"17","cant even login"
"18","this app has helped me with mental health and sleep a lot the voices are soothing and the instructions are clear thank you for the experience"

"26","very good even for someone like me who isnt from indonesia the psikolog is very neutral that i dont feel nervous talking to them feel more comfortable instead"
"27","app is great tech team doing a great job but the psychologist far way too biased jugdemental and even say bad words about my story i dont know how they source psychologist or how the psychologist got their license in the first place"

"382","jasa konselor riliv yang katanya adalah psikolog tidak berbeda dengan auto bot apps yang me reply berdasarkan pertanyaan yang ada standar default nya dari satu sesi ke sesi yang lain pendalaman masalah jadi tidak berkesinambungan lebih hebat lagi adalah setiap isu dari x sesi perkenalanan dianggap bisa diselesaikan dlm sekejap ketika diberikan feedback agar bisa dicari cara komunikasi yg lebih efektif saya si pasien dianggap tidak kooperatif sangat mengecewakana"

"447","fitur notifikasi itu penting banget tapi gak ada di sini ambil paket perkenalan janjian sama konselornya udah chat di waktunya eh sejam kemudian dihubungin ada kendala di jalan kata konselornya kan bingung yak janjian lagi miss lagi gitu sampe paket angus katanya mau diperpanjang paketnya tapi nyatanya tetep angus paketnya ill rather looking for face  face counseling saya sedang mencoba untuk meminta refund atas hal ini"
"448","udah beli paket perkenalan sempet dischedule pertama tp missed reschedule tp tenaga ahli yg ga available mau reschedule tiba hilang paket konsultasinya riwayat konseling yg berlangsung kosong yg selesaipun kosong ga ada menu help juga jd yaudah anggep ilang aja untung cm paket perkenalan"

"454","saat meditasi sebaiknya diberi backsound yang menenangkan sehingga ketika pembicara berbicara lagi tidak terlalu kaget dan tetap bisa fokus"
"455","aplikasinya bagus dan sangat membantu bagi orang yang belum pernah meditasi atau konsultasi sama sekali hanya pada saat meditasi kadang ada bagian yang membuat saya kaget"
"456","ini saya baru coba berlangganan yg x saya sdh chat tp kok skrg ga bisa di cek lg chat nya padahal belum ada balasan apa tulisannya anda belum berlangganan padahal saya sdh bayar"
"457","saya akhirnya memutuskan berlangganan tapi ada yang ingin ditanyakan saya rasa alasan saya bergabung karena begitu ingin memulai sesi segera tapi bagaimana jika respon dari psikolog datang sangat lama saya tertarik mencobanya karena review mengatakan respon datang sangat cepat namun saya mendapatkan yang sebaliknya bisa tolong bantu saya untuk segera memulai sesi terima kasih"
"458","cukup membantu sihh aplikasi riliv ya saya coba yang teks paket perkenalan cuma sayangnya ternyata chat historynya ngga ada ya jadi setelah  sesi closed saya ga bisa cek lagi isi konsultasinya apa tau gitu saya capture chat saya dengan psikolognya tadi saya cuma inget beberapa poin aja sisanya ada yang panjangg banget psikolognya kasi saya udah lupa"
"459","update  gue masih memberi bintang  karena setelah konseling via line gue makin nyesel sudah membayar psikolog tidak membantu memberi solusi yang everybody knows it dan nggak melihat background pasien yang pasti punya akar permasalahan yang berbeda justru psikolog terkesan menyalahkan pasien gue gatau apa semua psikolog seperti itu atau bahkan apakah yang membalas konseling bener bener psikolog "
"460","aplikasi ini sagat bagus untuk mengurangi orang yang melakukan self harm"
"461","saya ingin memberikan rate positif karena misi yang dibawa dan share yang aktif dilakukan di media sosial namun saat saya butuh dan sudah membayar sesi konseling psikolog tidak pernah hadir email cs sangat slow respon dm ig juga slow respon banget jadi dengan keadaan ini saya ingin refund dan tidak memberi bintang  mohon kualitas layanannya diperbaiki tidak ada guna aktif di media sosial menjadi berita dimanamana jika saat yang dibutuhkan malah tidak memberikan manfaat apapun"
"462","aplikasi ini sangat membantu juga mudah digunakan"
"463","belum ada trial conseling sudah harus bayar"
"464","sudah bayar sudah chat tapi tidak ada balasan sedih"
"465","ide yang sangat baik memberikan kesempatan untuk bisa berkonsultasi dg psikolog pelayanan pun baik namun secara aplikasi masih terdapag banyak kekurangan misalkan fitur chat yang sering error sudah mengetik panjang namun tidak terkirim saat memencet di notifikasi tidak langsung tersambung dengan aplikasi alangkah baiknya jika riwayat konseling sebelumnya dapat dibuka karena biasanya org akan mudah lupa jika hanya dengan via percakapan chat saja tidak tatap muka semoga lebih baik lagi"
"466","sangat membantu dan psikolognya sangat baik"
"467","wah bagus banget dlu saya bocah halu skrng setelah konsultasi saya menjadi bocah yang rasional dan amanah"

"482","saya sudah bayar paket tapi tidak ada balasan ketika saya buka lagi ad balasan tapi tidak ad notifikasi kalau ad yg menghubungi bagaimana kalo melalui wa atau line saja krn aplikasinya ga ada notifikasi ya"
"483","saya sudah bayar untuk satu sesi tapi sampai sekarang belum ada balasan dari psikolognya padahal saya sangat perlu untuk konsultasi kalau tidak bisa menanggapi x jam mohon bantuannya agar bisa di refund"
"484","tim riliv sangat tanggap dalam mengatasi masalah atau keluhan pelanggan terima kasih sedikit con saya perlu menunggu waktu lebih dari satu hari untuk mendapatkan pesan awal setelah mengaktifkan paket konseling"
"485","pertama saya mau berterima kasih karena sudah membuat aplikasi seperti riliv sangat membantu hanya sayangnya masih banyak bug yg perlu diperbaiki juga tambahan saran untuk tim development beberapa bug ada saya temukan tapi terlalu panjang untuk dijelaskan disini akan saya kirimkan lewat email saja thank you"
"486","beli paket yg perkenalan sudah chat sama psikolog trus nentuin hari sabtu  jam  konseling sy pas jam  lngsung chat dgn psikolog tpi tdk ada balasan ternyata psikolog bales tpi tdk masuk ke dalam chat sy tentuin waktu lgi dan lgi sy chat tdk masuk ke chat psikolog  sebaliknya dalam proses konseling sangat tidak efektif karna tdk diketahui klo chat sudah terkirim atau blm  sedang typing atau chat sudah dibaca feature chat masih sangat kurang karna komunikasi sngt lambat"
"487","saya coba paket konseling yg  sesi sudah ada konfirmasi pembayaran tp dicoba pesannya belum beli paket sudah email jg ke customer service tp belum ada balasan update  saya masih blm terima email apa dr cs riliv ya dear  update  tetap tidak bs dan tidak ada email saya sdh gak berminat lg jd buat masukan perbaikan aja buat tim riliv agar servisnya lebih konsisten thanks"

"499","tidak bisa register null"
"500","sangat membantu buat orang yg belum pernah meditasi seperti saya"
"501","tidak bisa mendaftar"
"502","awesome"
"503","percuma konsep bagus kalo psikolog hanya available untuk orang yang tidak selfhrm menurut saya yang namanya psikolog itu ya memberi konseling kepada siapapun yang mengalami mental illness selepas orang tsb slfhrm atau tidak kecewa saya"
"504","tanya min klo semisal konseling masalah anxiety yg udah menahun apa bisa min udah sempet cari psikolog tetapi berhubung saya tinggal di daerah dan kebanyakan org masih awam lebih tepatnya gangguan cemas susah tidur udah sempet baca jg di inet apa bisa min dan jikalau kejadian terburuk butuh resep obat dr dokter bisa min"
"505","terimakasih riliv sangat membantu aku untuk konseling sukses ya kedepannya"

"510","gabisa pake bpjs"
"511","pelanggan dari awal aplikasi riliv dulu sampe skrg so far makin diperbaharui sih aplikasinya ud bagus banget kalo bisa psikolog yg available lebih banyak karna kadang butuh hari ini juga untuk jadwal session"
"512","saya pengguna riliv baru baca review lain byk yg ngeluh tp sy pribadi jujur puas sekali krn mau mencari jasa psikolog kdg sulit dan bingung hrus cari dimana blm lgi kalau org skitar kurang mendukung atau jadwal yg tdk memungkinkan untk bikin janji temu secara tatap muka chat nya via line psikologny ramah dan sabar sy sgt terbantu dgn adanya riliv harganya juga masih sangat terjangkau semoga bs terus maju dan sukses ya riliv dan seluruh tim nya "
"513","mau curhat kok bayar overall bagus tinggal ditambah fitur tambahan lainnya seperti tips tips dll"
"514","lebih suka riliv yang dulu dimana setiap orang bisa saling membantu dan mendengarkan keluhan secara anonim melalui komunitas fitur komunitas sangat membantu banyak orang termasuk saya tapi sayang sekarang hanya bisa konsultasi dengan psikolog its not a bad thing malah sangat bagus karena bisa langsung kontak dengan psikolog yang ada tapi maaf gak semua orang mampu dan berpikiran harus mengeluarkan biaya untuk konsultasi seperti ini"
"515","aplikasi selalu crash saat dibuka moga bisa cepat diperbaiki"
"516"," buat riliv saya bingung kenapa ada yg kasih  haha layanan dari psikolog nya memuaskan banget seandainya bisa service ff dengan psikolog melalui riliv saya yang pertama akan subscribe hehe riliv tlg fix kalau chat ada delay dengan apa yg diketik di keyboard dan dengan tampilan di layar chat dengan psikolog juga ngga bisa saya copaste ke clipboard samsung sebetulnya untuk saya archive sewaktu bisa dibaca ulang"

"754","app ini sangat tidak membantu saya sama sekali ujungnya psikolog hanya meminta saya untuk menyelesaikan masalah saya sendiri terus psikolog gak tau sopan santun gak pake salam dan semacamnya dan langsung menyelesaikan sesi tiba tiba uang gak dikembalikan gak masalah terserah mau diganti atau tidak tapi jika tidak ada reply dari kalian sama sekali ini totally scam dan mempermainkan kesehatan mental seseorang"

"759","bagus meditation nya tapi konsultasinya gk recommended sih  coba paket yang sekali konsultasi langsung gak pgn lagi hehe psikolog cenderung memojokkan dan bikin aku malah jadi makin ngedown rasanya ada beberapa masukan yg berguna tp ya gk bnyak  ada nanya tentang background aku tp nanya doang gk kasih conclusion atau saran apa  gk fast respon padahal dh mantengin hp terus biar  jam bisa bener efektif"
"760","mohon aplikasinya ditingkatkan khususnya bagian chattingkonseling user experience kurang nyaman ketika idle lalu ada notif jawaban dari psikolognya kemudian klik notifikasi untuk buka chatnya tidak langsung masuk ke halaman chat tapi loading dr awal lagi sama pesan dari pengguna dan psikolog serasa ada jeda sekian detik jadi kadang tidak realtime percakapannya psikolognya sendiri sudah bagus responsif semangat tim riliv youre on the right direction"
"761","baru coba aplikasi ini sebenarnya bagus aplikasi ini bisa share uneguneg dengan nama samaran tapiiiiiiiiiii ini rawan kalo pake yang free itu pas di pertengahan sesi curhat rawan banget topik berganti jadi hal di luar yang semestinya kita gak kenal orang itu terus dia minta data yang agak pribadi di chat ini ganggu sih saran gue buat kalian yang coba ini mending ke expert langsung tapi coba direview lagi chat yang gratis ini soalnya rentan digunain sebagai ajang sok kenal sok dekat terlebih lagi si supports ini ada aja yang gak solved permasalahan kita lebih ke jawaban sekenanya aja   thx"

"763","haii reliv sebelumnya saya ucapkan terimakasih banyak telah memberikan sumbangsih terhadap ilmu psikologi khusus nya untuk memasuki era psikologi digital first sight sensasi yang saya dapatkan adalah aplikasi ini kurang dapat di sisi formalitas nya hal ini dikarenakan pada saat pengisian biodata tidak terlalu lengkaphal ini mungkin data confidential namun kembali dari proses pembuatan apps bahwa bagaimana memberikan kenyamanan dan keamanan dari customerklien selanjutnya adalah pada hal raportkesan pertama pada saat customer memulai chat gratis dengan community support saya rasa dengan yakin bahwa support tidak memulai nya denga good raport  lalu yg terakhir adalah apps ini tidak memberikan experience terhadap customer karena kalo kita merujuk pada ecommerce maka customer experience adalah suatu hal yang sangat wajib  but di luar dari itu semua nice try untuk riliv kerja hebat"
"764","gabisa daftar lewat apapun"
"765","sangat buruk setiap mau konseling pasti selalu error periksa koneksi internet padahal buka aplikasi lain jalan"
"766","terima kasih telah membantu saya untuk lebih tenang dalam menghadapi masalah yang saya hadapi"
"767","thats a perfect app everyone must installed it"
"768","aku suka pelayanannya scr teknis tapi saat aku konseling dengan psikolog ttg isu yg sgt sensitif advicenya gak membantu sm sekali bukannya bersikap netral tapi dia malah bias dgn personal valuenya advicenya jg out of context dan ga relevan penuturan bahasa dan penyampaian pesannya pun ada bbrp yg kurang sopan mungkin di app lain ini byk expert lain yg bagus tp mungkin aku bad luck aja akan lebih baik kl kita bs pilih psikolog sendiri jd bs background check sendiri"
"769","daftar aja susah gimana mau bantu konseling"
